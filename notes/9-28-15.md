###Notes

####Images

Images are a two-dimensional array with a width and height.
Each individual element is called a **pixel**.
Images are non-structured other than a 2D array.

###Video

Videos are nothing but moving images. Depending on how many frames (images) are displayed per second,
that gives us an fps.

####Terms
    -FPS (Frames per second): number of frames displayed per second
    -Aspect ratio: ratio of width to height

###2D/3D Graphics

Imagine a blue square. Instead of storing the whole shape, vector graphics store information about the image.
An image reads the file pixel by pixel and renders the image on the screen.

###Animation

    -Time dependent directives (programs to be executed at playtime)
    -Compactness and revisable
    -Requires processing power for rendering and playback

###Audio

    * Properties
        -Sampling rate in hertz: # of samples per second.
        -Sample size: number of bits per sample
        -Dimensionality: number of channels (mono or stereo)
        -Frequency range or frequency band (narrow band voice vs. wide band music)
