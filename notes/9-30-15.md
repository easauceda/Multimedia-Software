#Digital Image Data Representations
##24bit to 8bit Color Quantization

##Image

* When you mix colors in equal values, you lose color.

    ####1-bit Images

    * Each pixel is stored as a single bit.

    * FileSize of 640x480: **37.5KB**

    #####8-bit Gray Images

    * Each pixel is stored as a byte (8 bits).
    
    * File size of 640x480: **300KB**
    
##Alpha Channel

* Denoted as ùù∞
* An additional channel that suggests a measure of the transparency for that pixel value.
* It is used in image compositing applications, such as blue screen matting.
* Ranges from **1 for opaque** to **0 for transparent**.
