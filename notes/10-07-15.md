##Analog Signal/Digital Data

Terminology:
- Analog signal: continuous signal
- Digital data: discrete numbers
- Digitization: a process that converts analog signal to digital data

##Digitization

Two steps:
1. Sampling
2. Quantization

###Sampling

Extracting a subset of a signal. Record the value of the signal at a certain point on the x-axis. Repeat over a certain distance on the x-axis.

After sampling, each point has a certain value. However, to represent the value with finite bits, there has to be quantization.

###Quantization

We convert a value to finite bits because some values would need infinite bits to be represented accurately.

xs(n) -> xq(n)


###Digitization

Digitization comprises of two steps:

x(t) -> x(nT) = xs(n)

Where n = 1 and T is the sampling period.

##Bit Rate Relation to Sampling and Quantization

- As sampling rate increases, bit rate increases.
- As quantization bits used increases, bit rate increases.

##Nyquist-Shannon's Sampling Theorem

A continuous signal can be completely reconstructed from a set of equally spaced samples **iff** the sampling frequency is greater than twice the highest frequency of the signal.
