## Recap from last class

- Coding efficieny cannot exceed one

## Coding Algorithms:

### Shanon-Fano Algorithm

- You create a binary tree by dividing the string. 
- The groups should be close in frequency.
- Once the groups have been divided down to single symbols
- The symbol with the highest frequency should have the shortest length

### Huffman Coding

- Uses a binary tree structure similar to Shanno-Fanno
- Bottom-up approach
- Picks the groups with the lowest frequency first
- The middle node does not represent any symbol, the leaf nodes do
- Huffman is superior to Shanon-Fano

## Huffman Coding and its Extension

- These days, every compression method is hybrid (Lossy then lossless)
- Extended Huffman Coding assigned a codeword to a sequence instead of a single symbol

### Adaptive Huffman Coding

- The Huffman algorithm required prior statistical knowledge, but sometimes that data isn't available (live video/audio)
- Adaptive Huffman coding uses the probabilities that are based on actual data coming in.

**Steps**
1. Initial_Code(); (When there's no data sent, use this initial code)
2. while not end_of_stream
  a. get(c)
  b. encode(c)
  b. update_tree(c)
