##LZW - Pattern Substitution

- Invented by Lempel and Zic in 1978

### Encoding Process

1. Initialize the dictionary to contain all single/initial symbols
2. While scanning the message to compress, search for the longest sequence of symbols that has appeared as an entry in the dictionary. Call this enry E.
3. Encode E in the message by its index in the dictionary.
4. Add a new entry to the dictionary, which is E followed by the next symbol in the scan.
5. Repeat the process until you reach the end of the message.
