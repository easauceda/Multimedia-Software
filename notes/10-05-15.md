#Week Two, Day One Notes

##Dithering

Dithering changed the image size.

For example, if you have a 10x10 image (100px), 1 single pixel will map to a number of pixels.

The way we map that pixel is by using k x k.

If k = 2, then the new image will be 20x20.

This conversion can be defined by a Dither Matrix.

##Dithering Matrix

Example:

	k = 2 => D = | 0 2 |
		     | 3 1 |

Each entry corresponds to a position on the new image. If the number in the matrix is **less** than that of the entry, the pixel is turned on.

One limitation that this approach incurs is stripes may occur if the intensity is constant.

##Error Diffusion

When trying to display an image having colors more in number than the display device, a selection has to be made to approximate the value of the display color.

This can be done using:
1. Dynamic Color Quantization
2. Precompiled Lookup Tables
