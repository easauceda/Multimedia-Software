##Why Compression?

Media as a format is very bulky.

##Types of Compression

1. Lossless
 -Does not lost info
 -Produces a variable bit-rate
 -Not guaranteed to actually reduce the size

2. Lossy
 -Loses some information in order to lose (hopefully) a large amount of size

##Lossless Compression

The basic idea:

Translate each symbol represented by a fixed number of bits into a "codeword"

##Average Symbol Length

Consider the data "ABBACDAA"

Symbol length: 2 bits per symbol

Total number of symbols (M) = 8

Number of bits emitted: M * (Symbol Length) = 8 * 2 = 16

Average Symbol Length = Probability(symbol) * (symbol length)
